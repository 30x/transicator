  title: changeserver
  description:
    Changeserver consumes changes from a Postgres replication scheme created
    by the "transicator_output" plugin and makes them available to consumers
    via an API. The API supports long polling so that a large number of
    consumers may be notified of changes.

    get:
      description:
        Retrieve a list of changes. The query parameters may be used to
        restrict the number of changes that are retrieved or return
        only changes since a particular sequence. In addition, it
        is possible to block (aka "long poll") until a new matching
        change is available. The result will be produced in JSON format
        unless the Accept header is used to select the protobuf format.
      produces:
        - application/json
        - application/transicator+protobuf
      parameters:
        - name: scope
          in: query
          description:
            The scope limits the changes that are returned. It is
            extracted from a database column whenever a change is
            made. Every call to this API must contain at least one
            scope. Multiple "scope" parameters may also be used.
            if more than one "scope" is included, then the operation
            is treated as an "OR" of all the scopes, and the results
            are sorted by sequence regardless of scope.
          required: true
          type: string
        - name: snapshot
          in: query
          description:
            If specified, then this must be set to a "snapshot ID" from Postgres.
            This will be in the format "xmin:xmax:xip1,xip2,...xipN" and is
            normally returned by executing "select txid_current_snapshot()".
            By including this parameter, the change list will never include
            any data that would be *visible* in the specified snapshot.
            So in other words, if the value of this parameter comes from
            a Postgres query executed during a transaction, then the
            change server will not return any database changes that
            were already in the snapshot.

          type: string
        - name: since
          in: query
          description:
            The value of "sequence" from a previous invocation of
            this API. If so specified, this API will only return changes
            that happened after the change with the specified sequence.
            Otherwise, this API will return changes since the
            beginning.
          required: false

        - name: limit
          in: query
          description:
            Limit the number of changes returned by a single API
            call. The default limit is 100.
          required: false
          type: integer
        - name: block
          in: query
          description:
            If specified, this sets the number of seconds that the API
            call will block if there are no changes available since the
            "since" value for the set of specified scopes. In the
            event that there are no changes available when the API call
            is made, the API will block for the specified number of
            seconds until a matching change appears. If no changes
            appear in the specified number of seconds, then an
            empty change list will be returned.
