  title: snapshotserver
  description:
    The Snapshot server produces a consistent view of data in a Postgres database
    for a set of "scopes." Each scope is a unique string identified by a column
    called "_apid_scope" in each table. Tables with no such column are
    ignored.

      description: 
        Generate and create the data for a snapshot. The snapshot will contain
        data from all tables in the current database and schema that has a
        column named "_apid_scope" that matches one of the "scope" values.
        The generated snapshot includes JSON data by default. The "Accept" header
        may be used to request data in protocol buffer format.

            The "scope" field represents a unique identifier that is required in
            order to generate a snapshot. The snapshot will contain data from all
            tables that have an "_apid_scope" column that matches the value.
            At least one scope must be included. If multiple scopes are included,
            then the result is treated as an "OR" of all the scopes.
